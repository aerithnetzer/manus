# MANUS

## Description

Manus is a python package that aims to address the problem of manuscript preparation for scholarly publications. Specifically, journal editors and publishers struggle to make sure the manuscripts they receive are properly formatted and web-accessible. The goal of Manus is to provide an extensible tool that can be integrated within the build process of your manuscript or digital publication.

We want to make it easy for you to create a manuscript that is web-accessible, properly formatted, and ready for submission to a journal or publisher.
