# Features of the Manus Package

## 1. Manuscript Transformation

The manus package will transform your author-provided Docx files into a well-formatted plain text file. (`.md`, `.txt`, `.tex`, `.html`, `.xml`)
The package will also generate a `metadata.json` file that contains the metadata of the manuscript.
